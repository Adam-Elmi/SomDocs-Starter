# Features

SomDocs comes packed with features to help you write better documentation.

## MDX Support

You can use standard Markdown syntax alongside interactive components.

### Code Blocks

We support syntax highlighting out of the box with our custom `Code` component.

<Code filename="example.js">
```js
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```
</Code>

### Callouts / Messages

Use the `Message` component to highlight important information.

<Message type="note">
This is a **note** callout. Useful for general information.
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
This is a **tip**! Use this for helpful advice.
</Message>

<Message type="warning">
**Warning!** Watch out for this.
</Message>

<Message type="error">
**Error!** Critical information that shouldn't be missed.
</Message>

## Auto-generated Sidebar

The sidebar is automatically generated based on your file structure in `src/pages/`. You don't need to manually maintain a list of links.

## Full Text Search

Integrated full-text search powered by Pagefind allows users to instantly find the content they are looking for.

## Dark Mode

A beautiful dark mode is included by default, respecting the user's system preference but also toggleable manually.
