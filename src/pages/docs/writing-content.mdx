# Writing Content

SomDocs uses **MDX** (Markdown with JSX), allowing you to write standard markdown while embedding interactive components.

## Adding a New Page

1.  Navigate to `src/pages/docs/`.
2.  Create a new file with the `.mdx` extension, e.g., `my-new-page.mdx`.
3.  Add the required **Frontmatter** at the top of the file:

<Code filename="my-new-page.mdx">
```yaml
---
layout: "../../layout/DocLayout.astro"
title: My New Page
description: A short summary of what this page is about.
---

# My New Page

Start writing your content here...
```
</Code>

<Message type="warning">
    Always ensure `layout` is set correctly. Without it, your page will lack the sidebar and header.
</Message>

## Organizing with Folders

You can group related pages into folders.

1.  Create a folder in `src/pages/docs/`, e.g., `advanced/`.
2.  Add `.mdx` files inside it.
3.  The text format of the folder name in the sidebar will be automatically generated (e.g., `advanced-topic` becomes `Advanced Topic`).

## Sidebar Order

By default, files are sorted alphabetically or by the order found. To explicitly set the order of top-level items, edit `somdocs.config.json`:

<Code filename="somdocs.config.json">
```json
{
  "onTop": ["introduction", "installation", "my-new-page"]
}
```
</Code>

Items in `onTop` will appear first in the sidebar, in the order specified.
